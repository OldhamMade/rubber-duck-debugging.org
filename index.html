        <p class="intro">
          Rubber Duck Debugging (a.k.a. rubber-ducking) is an informal term used in
          software engineering for a method of debugging code.
        </p>

      </div>

      <div class="main-contents">

        <h2>How do I do it?</h2>

        <p>The method itself is quite simple:</p>

        <ul class="steps">
          <li><span class="step">Step 1:</span>
            Obtain a rubber duck. Any duck will do; larger, bath-time ducks are
            preferred, but keyring ducks are acceptable and can be handy to keep
            around.  You can even use the one above in a pinch.
          </li>
          <li><span class="step">Step 2:</span>
            Explain your code to the "duck". You must remember to:
            <ul>
              <li>
                Explain each logical step/branch out loud and in detail
              </li>
              <li>
                Point to the screen as you do this, so the duck knows which
                lines/syntax/text you're referring to
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><span class="step">Step 3:</span>
            Continue until the solution to the problem is provided by the duck's
            serene attention.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How does it work?</h2>

        <p>
          Rubber ducks originated from the Tibetan mountain encampments of Zen
          monks, who would use small wooden duck statues as a meditation aid. Over
          millenia the concentration of Zen masters was focussed on these statues,
          flooding them with thoughtwaves, which were captured and
          stored. Eventually, once the Zen masters had reflected on the statues
          enough, these ducks were gifted to small children in local villages, who
          would use them as toys during bathing. It was found that children who
          received the ducks would sleep more soundly and their nature would
          become calmer, which is why we have rubber ducks in many cultures around
          the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          It has been found that, through quantum morphic resonance, any item
          which follows the shape of the original statues becomes a receptical for
          the Zen contemplations. This deliberation leaks out of the ducks as
          delta-waves, and in talking to the ducks we latch on to these
          delta-waves which ties us directly into a mystical thought-network which
          permeates the globe. When using a colleague as a duck, the colleague
          must hold the shape of a rubber duck in their mind, to act as a bridge
          to the mystical thought-network.
        </p>

        <h2><em>...right...</em> but how does it <em>really</em> work?</h2>

        <p>
          As developers we can become so familiar with the code that we don't
          notice small errors creep in when we're "in the zone", writing the logic
          we need at this point in the source while focussing on the larger
          picture.
        </p>
        <p>
          The act of reading aloud slows us down, and pointing at the code forces
          us to review the syntax and logic directly under our finger. We can then
          easily see where the code is doing something different to what we
          *think* it is doing.

          <dt>What do I do if I can't get a duck?</dt>
          <dd>
            We've provided a duck above which should be able to assist if you
            can't get a physical duck. However, if you're somewhere without
            internet and still don't have a duck, then a colleague or other
            individual may be able to assist. Just remind them that they need to
            sit quietly while you explain the problem, otherwise your access to
            the mystical thought-network might time-out.
